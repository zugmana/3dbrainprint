Code for making souvenir brains in SDAN
There are two scripts here that need to be edited with the appropriate paths.
The code is provided as is and intended to use within our research group.
.
1 - Use the script in convert_to_stl.sh to run freesurfer recon-all and convert freesurfer files to .stl
2- Use the matlab code to smooth the meshes and merge left and right hemispheres.

p.s.: You will need to edit the paths in these codes to match your data. 

Future improvements:
Implement the scripts as functions so that we don't need to edit the paths.
